# Automatic UI Anchoring For Unity
Automatic UI Anchoring is a Unity Editor extension that saves time when creating UI that needs to be scaled to many different screen sizes by automatically setting the anchor positions of RectTransform components.

## Usage:
You can automatically set the anchor positions of all RectTransforms in a scene by selecting the option "Tools/AndrewRise1998/Automatic UI Anchoring/Automatically Anchor All UI Objects" from the top bar of the Unity Editor or
you can anchor only the RectTransforms of specific objects by selecting them in the hierarchy view and then choosing the option "/Tools/AndrewRise1998/Automatic UI Anchoring/Automatically Anchor Selected UI Objects".
